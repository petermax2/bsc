Implementation and Performance Analysis of Cryptographic Methods for Elektra


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	TASK DESCRIPTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Task Description}

Security has become a crucial aspect of modern day applications, especially when it comes to libraries.
\libelektra (or simply Elektra) is essentially a hierarchical key-value database that is intended to store configuration data. It features extensibility by providing a plugin system. The main reason why \libelektra should provide security measures is that application configurations often contain sensitive data (e.g. login credentials).

The goal is to enhance \libelektra to provide \textbf{confidentiality} for sensitive values.
Those values should be protected against unauthorized usage by means of symmetric encryption.
An existing implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) will be used for encryption.

Another security enhancement to \libelektra is to provide \textbf{integrity} for configuration files.
Therefore an RSA-based signature algorithm will be used to detect unauthorized changes between the time the file has been persisted and reloaded again.

However, security comes at a cost, namely: comfort and performance. The (possible) influences of security measures on the user experience are not covered in this thesis. The main question will be if the introduction of cryptographic methods leads to a significant decline in performance.

The following section describes the research questions, which arise from the task description.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	RESEARCH QUESTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Research Questions}

Let $t_e(x)$ denote the time the encryption of a value $x$ takes, and let $t_d(x)$ denote the time the decryption of a value $x$ takes.
The research questions examine the possible performance impact of cryptographic operations on Elektra:

\begin{enumerate}
\item How long does it take to encrypt and decrypt a typical password $p$, i.e. what are the mean values of $t_e(p)$ and $t_d(p)$? //TODO add literature ref about typical password strength
  
\item How big is the ratio of the time needed to encrypt a value $x$ in comparison to the total time of the persisting operation $T_p(x)$ for the value $x$, i.e. what is the mean value of $t_e(x)/T_p(x)$?
  
\item How big is the ratio of the time needed to decrypt a value $x$ in comparison to the total time of the loading operation $T_l(x)$ for the value $x$, i.e. what is the mean value of $t_d(x)/T_l(x)$?

\item How much impact has the length of the value $|x|$ on $t_d(x)$ and $t_e(x)$, i.e. what is the (statistical) asymptotic behaviour of $t_e(x)$ and $t_d(x)$?

\item How much time is needed for signing and verifying Elektra database files of different sizes?
  
\end{enumerate}

The next section provides details about how these questions will be examined.

%	METHODOLOGY
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Methodology}

So far the research question as well as the task description have been discussed.
This section provides detailed information about how the research questions can be answered step by step.

The \libelektra project is being used as a test environment, as mentioned in the task description.
The source code of the \libelektra project is available at GitHub:

\url{https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/}

The cryptographic operations will be provided by \libgcrypt, an open source cryptographic API, which is FIPS compliant and can thus be considered as ``sufficiently secure''.
This project will act as the real-world implementation and will be tested against the security threats in order to examine the research question.
The \libgcrypt project is hosted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and can be accessed at:

\url{http://www.gnu.org/software/libgcrypt/}

The first step is the integration of the security concepts into \libelektra. Confidentiality will be increased by providing encrypted values. In order to distinguish encrypted values and plain text, the key meta-informations (source file \texttt{keymeta.c}) will be extended. Encrypted valus will be persisted in Base64 encoding (RFC 4848, see \url{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648}). The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) will be used as symmetric cipher.

Once the symmetric encryption operations are integrated, test databases will be created. These databases are used to test the algorithm against known vulnerabilities. Security tests are either unit tests, that are integrated into the existing test suite, or stand-alone applications, depending on the complexity of the test setup and the required environment. The outcomes of these tests are evaluated and interpreted to answer part one of the research question.

Finally the integrity of the key database files will be assured by storing the signed SHA-512 hash value of the file content. RSA will be used for signing the hash values. If the handling of the RSA keypair for the signature procedure should decrease usability, integrity can be provided by storing a hashed message authentication code (HMAC). \libgcrypt supports all of these cryptographic operations, so changing the method for assuring integrity should not be much effort.

Again test cases will be used to attack known vulnerabilities of the implementations. Part two of the research question will be answered by evaluating and interpreting the outcomes of these tests.
