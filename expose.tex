\section{Title}

Increasing confidentiality and integrity in a hierarchical key-value database


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	TASK DESCRIPTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Task Description}

Security has become a crucial aspect of modern day applications, especially when it comes to libraries.
\libelektra is essentially a hierarchical key-value database that features extensibility by providing a plugin system.
There are two main reasons why such a project should provide security measures:

\begin{enumerate}
\item the library represents a single point of failure to all using applications, as the code is being shared
\item \libelektra is dealing with application configurations, which often contain sensitive data like login credentials or private keys
\end{enumerate}

The goal is to enhance \libelektra to provide \textbf{confidentiality} for stored username- and password values.
Those values will be protected against unauthorized usage by means of symmetric encryption.
An existing implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) will be used for encryption.

Another security enhancement to \libelektra is to provide \textbf{integrity} for configuration files.
Therefore an RSA-based signature algorithm will be used to detect unauthorized changes between the time the file has been persisted and reloaded again.

The following section describes the research questions, which arise from the task description.

%	RESEARCH QUESTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Research Question}

The research question examines the practical applications of cryptography in a cross-platform library environment and the possible increase in data security.
It consists of the following two parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Does a real-world Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) implementation offer confidentiality (i.e. protection against unauthorized access) for small data units?
Small data refers to values, that possibly fit into a single encryption block (e.g. passwords).
\item Can a real-world implementation of an RSA-based digital signature algorithm offer integrity (i.e. protection against unauthorized modification) for configuration files, that are persisted on a storage device (e.g. a hard drive)?
\end{enumerate}

The next section provides details about how these questions will be examined.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	METHODOLOGY
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Methodology}

So far the research question as well as the task description have been discussed.
This section provides detailed information about how the research questions can be answered step by step.

The \libelektra project is being used as a test environment, as mentioned in the task description.
The source code of the \libelektra project is available at GitHub:

\url{https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/}

The cryptographic operations will be provided by \libgcrypt, an open source cryptographic API, which is FIPS compliant and can thus be considered as ``sufficiently secure''.
This project will act as the real-world implementation and will be tested against the security threats in order to examine the research question.
The \libgcrypt project is hosted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and can be accessed at:
