# Bachelor Thesis #

This repository contains my Bachelor thesis.

## Abstract ##

TBD

## Generating the content ##

* Create a directory called `build`.

```
mkdir build
cd build
```

* Let CMake configure the build environment

```
cmake ..
```

* Use one of the Makefile targets to generate the content

```
make pdf
```

The [UseLATEX](https://github.com/kmorel/UseLATEX) project is being used for setting up the build environment for LaTeX.
