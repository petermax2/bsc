\chapter{Implementation}

This chapter describes the changes and enhancements that were made to Elektra in order to answer the research questions.

First we talk about Elektra's plugin API in general and how we used it to introduce cryptographic operations to Elektra.
Then the concept of the key management is presented.
At last some interesting implementation details about the crypto libraries used are given.
