\section{Motivation}

Security is a broad field of study and has become a cruical aspect of modern day application development.
One aspect of security is the protection of confidential data.
In this thesis we want to talk about confidentiality, the protection of data against unauthorized access, and integrity, the protection of data against unauthorized change.
Both of these goals can be achieved by utilizing cryptographic methods.

The reasons for the introduction of cryptographic methods into applications are obvious.
However, there might be drawbacks as well.
An increase in security could mean a decline in performance and usability.
More protection means more operations are to be executed and the key-- or password--management can be a burden to the user.

We are not going to discuss drawbacks in usability, but focus on the performance issue.
