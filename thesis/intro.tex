\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}

Security is a broad field of study and plays an important role in modern day application development.
One aspect of security is the protection of confidential data.
In this thesis we talk about confidentiality, the protection of data against unauthorized access, and integrity, the protection of data against unauthorized change.
Both of these goals are achieved by utilizing cryptography.

While cryptography is useful, are there drawbacks as well?
An increase in security induces a decline in performance and usability.
More protection causes overhead, so more operations are executed on the CPU.
The key-- and password--management are inconvenient for the user.

We are not going to discuss drawbacks in usability, but focus on the performance issue.

\todo{fill the gap -- den Bogen spannen}

OpenSSL and libgcrypt are two widely used cryptographic libraries and therefore good for benchmarking in real-world applications.
