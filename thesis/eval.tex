\chapter{Experimental Evaluation}

%\section{Methodology}

The focus of this chapter is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item how the benchmark system is set up
\item the exact definition and explanation how the benchmarks work and what is measured
\item the results of the benchmarks
\end{enumerate}

%The runtime of a benchmark will be measured using the system time, which is returned by the \texttt{gettimeofday ()} system function.
%
%The memory usage is examined using the ``Massif'' tool which is part of the \texttt{valgrind} suite.\cite{valgrind}

\section{Benchmark System Setup}
  \subsection{Hardware Setup}

The processor of the benchmark system is an Intel\textregistered~ Core\texttrademark~ i7-4771 CPU clocked at 3.50 GHz with 4 cores and hyperthreading enabled (which means 8 threads are available).
The benchmark system has a total of 16 GB of DDR3 RAM clocked at 1333 MHz available.

The root partition of the operation system is located on a ``Samsung SSD 840'' solid state drive (SSD).
It is installed on a ZFS filesystem.

The \texttt{diskinfo} program gives an idea of how much throughput the SSD can handle:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Disk performance on the benchmark system}]
Seek times:
  Full stroke:      250 iter in   0.014774 sec =    0.059 msec
  Half stroke:      250 iter in   0.012662 sec =    0.051 msec
  Quarter stroke:   500 iter in   0.024154 sec =    0.048 msec
  Short forward:    400 iter in   0.018797 sec =    0.047 msec
  Short backward:   400 iter in   0.018726 sec =    0.047 msec
  Seq outer:       2048 iter in   0.075078 sec =    0.037 msec
  Seq inner:       2048 iter in   0.074593 sec =    0.036 msec

Transfer rates:
  outside:       102400 kbytes in   0.221568 sec =   462161 kbytes/sec
  middle:        102400 kbytes in   0.218275 sec =   469133 kbytes/sec
  inside:        102400 kbytes in   0.217949 sec =   469835 kbytes/sec
\end{lstlisting}

All benchmarks are performend on the SSD.

  \subsection{Software Setup}

The operating system FreeBSD version 11.1 with patch level 1 is used to run the benchmarks.
Elektra \todo{version} at the git commit \todo{commit-nr} is installed inside a FreeBSD jail.\footnote{FreeBSD jails
are documented at \url{https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/jails.html}.
}
The exact setup of the benchmark jail is explained in appendix \ref{jail-setup} on page \pageref{jail-setup}.

The most important program versions are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
  \item FreeBSD clang version 4.0.0 (tags/RELEASE\_400/final 297347) (based on LLVM 4.0.0)
  \item Botan version 1.10.13\_3
  \item OpenSSL version 1.0.2k-freebsd
  \item libgcrypt version 1.8.0
  \item GnuPG version 2.1.21
\end{itemize}

In the following section the benchmarks are documented and explained in detail.
