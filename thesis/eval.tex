\chapter{Experimental Evaluation}

%\section{Methodology}

The focus of this chapter is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the setup of the benchmark system,
\item the definition of the benchmarks, and
\item the results of the benchmarks
\end{enumerate}

%The runtime of a benchmark will be measured using the system time, which is returned by the \texttt{gettimeofday ()} system function.
%
%The memory usage is examined using the ``Massif'' tool which is part of the \texttt{valgrind} suite.\cite{valgrind}

\section{Benchmark System Setup}
  \subsection{Hardware Setup}

The processor of the benchmark system is an Intel\textregistered~ Core\texttrademark~ i7-4771 CPU clocked at 3.50 GHz with 4 cores and hyperthreading enabled (which means 8 threads are available).
The benchmark system has a total of 16 GB of DDR3 RAM clocked at 1333 MHz available.

The root partition of the operation system is located on a ``Samsung SSD 840'' solid state drive (SSD).
It is installed on an ext4 filesystem.

The \texttt{hdparm} program gives an idea of how much throughput the SSD can handle. The results are listed in the table \ref{eval-ssd} on page \pageref{eval-ssd}.

\label{eval-ssd}
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\textbf{}                   & \textbf{data read} & \textbf{time} & \textbf{result} \\ \hline
Timing cached reads         & $28536 MB$         & $1.99 s$      & $14316.64 MB/s$ \\
Timing buffered disk reads: & $1608 MB$          & $3.00 s$      & $535.47 MB/s$   \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

All benchmarks are performend on the SSD.

  \subsection{Software Setup}

The operating system Fedora 27 is used for running the benchmarks.
Elektra version 0.8.21 at the git commit \texttt{dfa9bb8}\footnote{The full commit hash is: dfa9bb89ada39996cac5c1abd21481e1e2181ad9} is installed on the system.
\todo{update Elektra version and commit}

The most important program versions are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
  \item clang version 5.0.1 (tags/RELEASE\_501/final)
  \item Botan version 1.10.17-1.fc27
  \item OpenSSL version 1.1.0g-1.fc27
  \item libgcrypt version 1.8.2-1.fc27
  \item GnuPG version 2.2.4-1.fc27
\end{itemize}

In the following section the benchmarks are documented and explained in detail.
