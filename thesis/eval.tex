\chapter{Experimental Evaluation}

%\section{Methodology}

The focus of this chapter is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item how the benchmark system is set up
\item the exact definition and explanation how the benchmarks work and what is measured
\item the results of the benchmarks
\end{enumerate}

%The runtime of a benchmark will be measured using the system time, which is returned by the \texttt{gettimeofday ()} system function.
%
%The memory usage is examined using the ``Massif'' tool which is part of the \texttt{valgrind} suite.\cite{valgrind}

\section{Benchmark System Setup}
  \subsection{Hardware Setup}

The processor of the benchmark system is an Intel\textregistered~ Core\texttrademark~ i7-4771 CPU clocked at 3.50 GHz with 4 cores and hyperthreading enabled (which means 8 threads are available).
The benchmark system has a total of 16 GB of DDR3 RAM clocked at 1333 MHz available.

The root partition of the operation system is located on a ``Samsung SSD 840'' solid state drive (SSD).
It is installed on a ZFS filesystem.

The \texttt{diskinfo} program gives an idea of how much throughput the SSD can handle. The results are listed in the tables \ref{eval-ssd-seek} on page \pageref{eval-ssd-seek} and \ref{eval-ssd-transfer} on page \pageref{eval-ssd-transfer}.

All benchmarks are performend on the SSD.

  \subsection{Software Setup}

The operating system FreeBSD version 11.1 (patch level 1) is used for running the benchmarks.
Elektra \todo{version} at the git commit \todo{commit-nr} is installed inside a FreeBSD jail.\footnote{FreeBSD jails
are documented at \url{https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/jails.html}.
}
The exact setup of the benchmark jail is explained in Appendix \ref{jail-setup} on page \pageref{jail-setup}.
More general information about jails and FreeBSD can be found in the \emph{FreeBSD Handbook}.\cite{freebsd-doc}

The most important program versions are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
  \item FreeBSD clang version 4.0.0 (tags/RELEASE\_400/final 297347)
  \item Botan version 1.10.13\_3
  \item OpenSSL version 1.0.2k-freebsd
  \item libgcrypt version 1.8.0
  \item GnuPG version 2.1.21
\end{itemize}

In the following section the benchmarks are documented and explained in detail.
